# foobar-challenges
my Python scripts to solve google foobar problems. Here is a brief description of what the scripts are:
- GoogleChallenge.py: a function that takes for input an integer, and decomposes it into a sum of squares of integers, starting with the largest one.
- GoogleChallenge2.py: a function that takes for input the height h of a perfect binary tree, which is traversed in the postorder way, together with a list of nodes of the tree, and returns a list of the parents of those nodes.
- GoogleChallenge2b.py: a function that takes for input a list of positions of the centers of adjacent gears along an axis, and returns the radius of the first gear such that the last gear rotates twice as fast as the first gear (if such a radius exists). 
- GoogleChallenge3.py: a function that takes for input a list l of positive integers, and returns the number of "lucky triples" in the list. A "lucky triple" is a tuple of the form (l[i], l[j], l[k]) such that i < j < k, and such that l[i] divides l[j] and l[j] divides l[k].
- GoogleChallenge3b.py: a function that takes an integer n and returns the smallest number of steps to go from n to 1 by the operations: adding or subtracting 1, or - if the integer is even - dividing by 2.
- GoogleChallenge3c.py: a function that takes a matrix of non-negative integers, thought of as an absorbing Markov matrix, and returns a list of possibilities to transition from a given initial state to all the absorbing states.
