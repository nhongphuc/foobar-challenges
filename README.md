# foobar-challenges
my Python scripts to solve google foobar problems. Here is a brief description of what the scripts are:
- GoogleChallenge.py: a function that takes for input an integer, and decomposes it into a sum of squares of integers, starting with the largest one.
- GoogleChallenge2.py: a function that takes for input the height h of a perfect binary tree, which is traversed in the postorder way, together with a list of nodes of the tree, and returns a list of the parents of those nodes.
- GoogleChallenge2b.py: a function that takes for input a list of positions of the centers of adjacent gears along an axis, and returns the radius of the first gear such that the last gear rotates twice as fast as the first gear (if such a radius exists).
